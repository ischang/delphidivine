# Delphi
Delphi is a web and iOS application (as of Aug 28, 2016) that determines whether you're able to stargaze tonight depending on weather conditions. It shows you a list of constellations during the time and hemisphere you're in -- tThe web app uses the Forecast.io API, and the iOS app uses the OpenWeatherMap API. 

Delphi was made for the slash hack (/hack) hackthon by hackerearth on August 28, 2016. The iOS app was written by Kavitha Dhanukodi, Vijesh Jain, Stephanie Chang, Debparna Pratiher, Caroline Ho and the web app and the web app was written by Stephanie Chang, with help of UI design from her team. 

This was written in pure Javascript and JQuery with hopes to be rewritten in React Js in the future.
